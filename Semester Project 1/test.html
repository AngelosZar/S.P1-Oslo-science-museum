            <h6>Come join us at oslo’s Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science accessible
                to
                all.
                Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind,
                water,
                and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
