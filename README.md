Oslo science museum is an interactive static web-site that has been built with HTML and CSS .

The luck of javascript use is intentional and all interactivity is 'faked'  with css.
The reasoning behind this project is to showcase the importance of semantic HTML and importance as welll as how far can  CSS assist ti interactivity ,always trying to apply The DRY principle.

Client

Brief
Design and build a modern, accessible and responsive web presence for the client using the provided image and text content.

The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; while aiming at a younger audience it should not patronise them with overtly childish themes. The core purpose of the site is to excite and entice people to visit the museum.
